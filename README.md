# Project Summary â€“ Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts patient no-shows for healthcare appointments using the Kaggle Healthcare Appointment No-Show dataset (110,527 records).

The goal is to identify patterns that influence missed appointments and build predictive models to help clinics optimize scheduling, reduce wait times, and improve patient care.

*Key Insights from Analysis*

SMS reminders slightly reduce no-show rates.
Young adults tend to miss more appointments.
Mondays and Fridays show higher no-show frequency.
Longer waiting times correlate with higher no-show rates.

*Tools & Technologies*

Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Power BI: Interactive dashboards & KPIs

Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, SMOTE oversampling, model evaluation

*Model Performance*

Models tested: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost

Best Models: Random Forest & XGBoost (~80% recall for no-shows, ~59% accuracy)

Balanced performance for identifying high-risk patients

*Deliverables*

Python Notebook: Data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning models

Power BI Dashboard:

No-show trends over time

No-show rates by weekday

SMS reminder impact

Interactive filters for demographics

Final Report: Detailed methodology, results, and insights

*Conclusion*

By combining machine learning with interactive visualizations, this project provides actionable insights for healthcare scheduling optimization. Clinics can use these findings to reduce missed appointments and improve operational efficiency.
